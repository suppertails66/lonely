This is a special branch of Lonely specifically designed to create the hack Layla: The Iris Missions. The only real changes are to LaylaData.h and LaylaData.cpp, which include special functions that produce various hardcoded alterations to the imported and exported ROM data.

Note that to produce the "real" hack, a few changes were made directly to the ROM outside of the program, and thus won't be reflected in exported data without this special modified ROM:
* The Layla/Iris headswap
* The enhanced sound driver with support for a call/return mechanism
